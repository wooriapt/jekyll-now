  <h1>CUBE ON Token Sale Agreement_1</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p>Purchase Agreement_1</p>

<p>Last updated: June 1, 2018.</p>

<p>PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF TOKEN SALE CAREFULLY.
IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS OF SALE, DO NOT PURCHASE TOKENS.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Risk of Mining Attacks</li>
</ol>

<p>As with other decentralised cryptographic tokens based on the Ethereum protocol, the Tokens are susceptible to attacks by miners in the course of validating Token transactions on the Ethereum blockchain, including, but not limited, to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, and selfish-mining attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the Tokens, including, but not limited to, accurate execution and recording of transactions involving Tokens.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Risk of Hacking and Security Weaknesses</li>
</ol>

<p>Hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with the Tokens in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing and spoofing. Furthermore, because it is based on open-source software, there is a risk that a third party or a member of the Company team may intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses into the core infrastructure, which could negatively affect the Tokens.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Risks Associated with Markets for Tokens</li>
</ol>

<p>The Tokens are intended to be used solely within the Project, and Company will not support or otherwise facilitate any secondary trading or external valuation of Tokens. This restricts the contemplated avenues for using Tokens to the provision or receipt of Services and could therefore create illiquidity risk with respect to the Tokens you hold. Even if secondary trading of Tokens is facilitated by third party exchanges, such exchanges may be relatively new and subject to little or no regulatory oversight, making them more susceptible to fraud or manipulation. Furthermore, to the extent that third parties do ascribe an external exchange value to Tokens (e.g., as denominated in a digital or fiat currency), such value may be extremely volatile and diminish to zero.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Risk of Uninsured Losses</li>
</ol>

<p>Unlike bank accounts or accounts at some other financial institutions, Tokens are uninsured unless you specifically obtain private insurance to insure them. Thus, in the event of loss or loss of utility value, there is no public insurer, such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or private insurance arranged by us, to offer recourse to you.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Risks Associated with Uncertain Regulations and Enforcement Actions</li>
</ol>

<p>There is a risk that in some jurisdictions the CUBE ON tokens and other digital assets might be considered to be a “security”, or other regulated investment now or in the future. Company believes, but does not give representations, warranties or guarantees that tokens are not a security or regulated investment in all jurisdictions.</p>

<p>Each user of tokens shall bear their own legal or financial consequences of CUBE ON tokens being considered a security or other regulated investment in their respective jurisdiction.</p>

<p>Every user is required and bound to determine for themselves if the purchase, receipt, trading, use, transfer or disposal of tokens is legal in its jurisdiction, and hereby covenants and agrees not to use CUBE ON tokens should their use not be legal in the relevant jurisdiction.</p>

<p>If a user determines that the use of CUBE ON tokens under these Terms is not legal in its jurisdiction, it should not use the CUBE ON tokens, not acquire them and should immediately stop using or possessing them if such case arises.</p>

<p>Acquiring cryptographic tokens for personal possession and exchanging them for other cryptographic tokens will most likely continue to be scrutinized by various regulatory bodies around the world, which has so far given mixed reactions and regulatory impact. The legal ability of Company to provide CUBE ON tokens in some jurisdictions may be eliminated by future regulation or legal actions.</p>

<p>In the event, it turns out with a high degree certainty that CUBE ON tokens are not legal in certain jurisdiction, Company will either a) cease operations and possible use of CUBE ON tokens in that jurisdiction, or b) adjust CUBE ON tokens in a way to comply with the regulation should that be a possible and viable alternative.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Risks Arising from Taxation</li>
</ol>

<p>The tax characterization of Tokens is uncertain. You must seek your own tax advice in connection with purchasing Tokens, which may result in adverse tax consequences to you, including withholding taxes, income taxes and tax reporting requirements.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Risk of Alternative Networks</li>
</ol>

<p>It is possible that alternative networks could be established that utilize the same open source code and protocol underlying the Network and attempt to facilitate services that are materially similar to the Services. The Network may compete with these alternative networks, which could negatively impact the Network and Tokens.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Risk of Insufficient Interest in the Network or Distributed Applications</li>
</ol>

<p>It is possible that the Network will not be used by a large number of individuals, companies and other entities or that there will be limited public interest in the creation and development of distributed ecosystems (such as the Network) more generally. Such a lack of use or interest could negatively impact the development of the Network and therefore the potential utility of Tokens.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Risks Associated with the Development and Maintenance of the Network</li>
</ol>

<p>The Network is still under development and may undergo significant changes over time. Although we intend for the Tokens and Network to follow the specifications set forth in White Paper and intend to take commercially reasonable steps toward those ends, we may have to make changes to the specifications of the Tokens or Network for any number of legitimate reasons. This could create the risk that the Tokens, as further developed and maintained, may not meet your expectations at the time of purchase. Furthermore, despite our good faith efforts to develop and maintain, it is still possible that the Network will experience malfunctions or otherwise fail to be adequately developed or maintained, which may negatively impact the Tokens.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Risk of an Unfavourable Fluctuation of Ether and Other Currency Value</li>
</ol>

<p>The Company team intends to use the proceeds from selling Tokens to fund the maintenance and development of the Project. The proceeds of the Token sale will be denominated in Ether or Bitcoin and converted into other cryptographic and fiat currencies. In addition, some pre-sales of the Tokens may also be denominated in fiat currencies. If the value of Ether or other currencies fluctuates unfavourably during or after the Sale Period, the Company team may not be able to fund development or may not be able to develop or maintain the Network in the manner that it intended.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Risk of Dissolution of the Company or Network</li>
</ol>

<p>It is possible that, due to any number of reasons, including, but not limited to, an unfavourable fluctuation in the value of Ether (or other cryptographic and fiat currencies), decrease in the Tokens’ utility, the failure of commercial relationships, or intellectual property ownership challenges, the Network may no longer be viable to operate, and the Company may dissolve.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Risks Arising from Lack of Governance Rights</li>
</ol>

<p>Because Tokens confer no governance rights of any kind with respect to the Network or Company or its corporate affiliates, all decisions involving the Network or Company will be made by Company at its sole discretion, including, but not limited to, decisions to discontinue the Network, to create and sell more Tokens for use in the Network, or to sell or liquidate the Company. These decisions could adversely affect the Network and the Tokens you hold.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Risks Involving Cloud Storage</li>
</ol>

<p>As the Company provides a decentralised cloud storage service to individual and institutional clients, including users and applications, the Services are susceptible to a number of risks related to the storage of data in the cloud. While the Company does not have access to the contents of the data stored through the Services, the Services may involve the storage of large amounts of sensitive and/or proprietary information, which may be compromised in the event of a cyberattack or other malicious activity. Similarly, the Services may be interrupted and files may become temporarily unavailable in the event of such an attack or malicious activity. Because users can use a variety of hardware and software that may interface with the Network, there is the risk that the Services may become unavailable or interrupted based on a failure of interoperability or an inability to integrate these third-party systems and devices that the Company does not control with the Company’s Services. The risk that the Services may face increasing interruptions and the Network may face additional security vulnerabilities could adversely affect the Network and therefore the future utility of any Tokens that you hold.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Unanticipated Risks</li>
</ol>

<p>Cryptographic tokens such as the Tokens are a new and untested technology. In addition to the risks included in this article, there are other risks associated with your purchase, holding and use of Tokens, including those that the Company cannot anticipate. Such risks may further materialize as unanticipated variations or combinations of the risks discussed in this article.</p>
