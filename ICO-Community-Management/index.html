    <p>ICO Community Management.</p>

<p>ICOs are becoming the new standard for start-ups and business ventures around the world to gain investment by communities. 
Since January 2017, start-ups have raised more than USD1.8 billion through Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs).</p>

<p>Blockchain technology entrepreneurs worldwide raised more money through ICO than traditional venture capital investment. 
For most of the tokens, the ICO countdown has already begun.</p>

<p>However, due to a lack of proper resources, manpower, and legal issues, the preparation of an ICO is a complex project. 
It is important to have the right people on board to plan and launch the ICO campaign to target potential contributors around 
the world – in particular to get numerous big investors rather than a few whales.</p>

campaigns suffer from recurring questions related to the duration of the ICO campaign. 
Moreover, the campaign also receives recurring questions related to the general ICO details, start and end date, ico ratings, how to
participate and the supply of tokens after the successful completion of the ICO campaign. 
Some community managing experts build a system where the community members and potential investors are rewarded for the purpose of
spreading and advertising ICO campaign among another community members. 
They will therefore be rewarded for sharing, posting, uploading, joining, and commenting on the ICO campaign.</p>

<p>What benefits do ICOs enjoy if they have good community management?
It is important to act in various ICO community channels and platforms in order to keep the community happy and growing. 
It is not uncommon for there to be no user-driven communication for several hours in the community. 
But a member will not take an ICO or blockchain project seriously if he sees that the last message/comment was a while ago.</p>

<p>So, community management experts constantly work on different online platforms and search for contribution and articles about the
ICO project.
