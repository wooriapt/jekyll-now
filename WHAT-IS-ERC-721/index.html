    <p>WHAT IS ERC-721?</p>

<p>ERC-721 is a free, open standard that describes how to build non-fungible or unique tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. While most tokens are fungible 
(every token is the same as every other token), 
ERC-721 tokens are all unique.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Think of them like rare, one-of-a-kind collectables.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>ERC-20: A CLASS OF IDENTICAL TOKENS.</p>

  <p>ERC-721: A CLASS OF UNIQUE TOKENS</p>
</blockquote>

<p>###THE STANDARD###</p>

<p>ERC-721 defines a minimum interface a smart contract must implement to 
allow unique tokens to be managed, owned, and traded. 
It does not mandate a standard for token metadata or restrict adding 
supplemental functions.</p>

<p>ERC-721 started as a EIP draft written by @dete and first came to life in the CryptoKitties project by Axiom Zen</p>

<p>ERC-721 has since moved out of beta and into a community formalized v1 spec, supported and endorsed by a large number of projects from across the crypto ecosystem. This EIP wouldn’t be possible without time and dedication from a number of community members. Special thanks to @fulldecent and others who have put in tremendous amounts of work to push this forward.</p>
