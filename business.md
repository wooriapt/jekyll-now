#### Issue & Interact with Standard Token Contracts on Ethereum

Each brand and company enters the platform in the form of a consortium and publishes its own brand token. Customers can use this token as well as freely exchange them for a new shopping experience. Lab Tokens, which is its own token in Lab Tokens functions as a kind of key telephone. Each brand must issue tokens in conjunction with Lab Tokens, which will be valued at a fraction of the value of Lab Tokens. Exchange ratio. A protocol that uses tokens issued by each company and brand and can trade freely with each other. When a consumer or company exchanges between brand tokens, the amount to be exchanged is determined based on Lab Tokens.  
각 브랜드와 기업들은 컨소시엄 형태로 플랫폼에 들어오게 되고, 각자의 브랜드 토큰을 만들어 발행한다. 고객들은 이 토큰을 사용할 뿐만 아니라 자유롭게 교환함으로써 새로운 쇼핑 경험을 할 수 있다. Lab Tokens의 자체 토큰인 Lab Tokens가 일종의 기축통화 기능을 하는 셈이다. 각 브랜드는 Lab Tokens에 연계해 토큰을 발행하며 그 발행량에 따라 가치가 Lab Tokens의 몇 분의 1로 정해지게 된다. 교환비율이 생기는 셈이다.

각 기업 및 브랜드가 발행하는 토큰을 사용하고 상호 자유롭게 거래할 수 있는 프로토콜. 소비자, 기업이 각 브랜드 토큰 간 교환을 할 때도 Lab Tokens를 기준으로 교환할 양이 정해진다.

### BlockChain Loyalty Programs

Install Ethereum node software:Metamask Chrome Extension
We suggest Metamask as they provide a fully synced Ethereum node and only takes 3 mins to setup. Parity requires storing the blockchain locally and takes time to sync your node. Power users may benefit from Parity (such as high volume sellers and escrows), as it loads transaction history quicker.

The Dapp is developed on Google chrome, Parity and Metamask. Other ethereum node and browser combinations may work, but are untested and unsupported.

Using the dashboard
Escrow Ether has seperate dashboards for buyers, sellers and escrow agents.
