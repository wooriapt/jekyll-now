|CUBE ON Arbitration and Utility Token (XCB)..?   |
| ------------ |
|The CUBE ON Arbitration and Utility Token (XCB) is an ERC20 compatible in-app token for the CUBE ON Jurisdiction.  The XCB token rewards good reputation and is issued on CUBE ON when Citizens accumulate non-tradable reputation tokens through creating a contract, successfully completing a contract or resolving a dispute attached to a contract. XCB is an algorithmic reputation token, an arbitration currency based on performance rather than purchasing power, popularity or attention. The distribution mechanism for XCB tokens on CUBE ON is an autonomous agent, which will initially launch on Ethereum as a smart contract. This mechanism is blockchain agnostic and can be ported to any viable smart contract platform. LitePaper |
