# And will QuarkChain ever be able to build the blockchain they are promising?
QuarkChain is claiming to build a blockchain solution which will eventually reach a gazillion transactions per second and will solve the scalability issues for forever. They have recently completed their crowdsale. In this article we will discuss if they have actually met their promises related to their crowdsale.
# The Whitelisting Procedure and the lottery (as planned)
During the whitelisting, QuarkChain used three main aspects to determine the scores of interested crowdsale participants. 
      a. Timestamp of Telegram join 
      b. Your understanding of the product
      c. Your contribution to the project
QuarkChain also explained their lottery system in a steemit article. Following is a part of their lottery system explanation:
