Are you a consultant?
We  consultants. We offer special training and support for consultants looking to use  
**Consider.it** with their clients, as well as access to pricing incentives you can pass onto clients.  
[Please introduce yourself](https://consider.it/contact?form=consultant_partnership "Please introduce yourself").



**We are now sailing with a large wind**

### Tech Questions
How can I brand my forum and give it my organizationâ€™s look and feel?
When you upgrade to an Unlimited or Enterprise plan, you have the option to work with us to create a customized look and feel. 
We cover that in the one hour setup call that comes with every Unlimited forum. See some examples.

#### How much can I expect to pay per month on the Unlimited plan? 
Can I set a monthly budget?

Yes, we can work with you to set a monthly budget that makes sense for your use case 
if you need a hard cap. 
A monthly budget is the total amount you are willing to spend collecting opinions in a month. 
You will never be charged more than this monthly budget. 
You only pay for how much you use. 
For reference, a small non-profit engaging stakeholders for strategic planning might 
collect around 750 opinions over three months.
A large city hosting a dialogue about an important topic may collect closer to 5000 opinions.

### Pricing Questions
Can you explain how the Free Forum works?

You can create a free forum and use it for as long as you want. 
This forum is public by default, but you can make it invite-only. 
The forum comes with most of the standard features. The main limitation is that only the 25 most recent questions will 
be listed on the forum homepage. Upgrade to the Unlimited Forum if you want access to all the questions posted in your forum 
(or any of the other additional features with Unlimited, like a branded homepage).  






**What counts as an opinion? Why do you charge "per opinion" in the paid plans?**  
An opinion is collected when someone slides and saves their position on a question in your forum.   
Pro/con points are not counted.  
**27 opinions**
