#### How much can I expect to pay per month on the Unlimited plan? 
Can I set a monthly budget?

~~~~
Yes, we can work with you to set a monthly budget that makes sense for your use case 
if you need a hard cap. 
A monthly budget is the total amount you are willing to spend collecting opinions in a month. 
You will never be charged more than this monthly budget. 
You only pay for how much you use. 
For reference, a small non-profit engaging stakeholders for strategic planning might 
collect around 750 opinions over three months.
A large city hosting a dialogue about an important topic may collect closer to 5000 opinions.
~~~~
**What counts as an opinion? Why do you charge "per opinion" in the paid plans?**  
An opinion is collected when someone slides and saves their position on a question in your forum.   
Pro/con points are not counted.  
**27 opinions**
