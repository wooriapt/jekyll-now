#### Whitepaper v.5  
2018-08-13 21:32:56 monday
#### Summary    
Consumer acquisition and retention are a critical component of business growth and success, especially for Small to Medium Enterprises (SMEs). SMEs are the largest job creators in the world and offer great value to local communities however they are struggling to compete with large Multinational Corporations (MNCs). SMEs cannot compete on price due to the ability of MNC’s to take advantage of their economies of scale. However, with businesses working together they can reach a scale to compete on value. 
123OTT token believes that through a business-to-business universal loyalty rewards program SME's can increase consumer acquisition and retention. Native loyalty reward programs are difficult to manage, due to the time and resource requirements, and lack of an effective platform to measure success. Third party loyalty reward programs don't directly benefit the business and are not customizable. 
Due to these challenges only companies with the resources, subject matter expertise and ability to create and manage loyalty rewards programs can take advantage of such an opportunity. SMEs that can’t allocate the necessary time and resources to managing a loyalty rewards program are deprived of a powerful tool for business growth and success.

#### Summary    
Consumer acquisition and retention are a critical component of business growth and success, especially for Small to Medium Enterprises (SMEs). SMEs are the largest job creators in the world and offer great value to local communities however they are struggling to compete with large Multinational Corporations (MNCs). SMEs cannot compete on price due to the ability of MNC’s to take advantage of their economies of scale. However, with businesses working together they can reach a scale to compete on value. 
123OTT token believes that through a business-to-business universal loyalty rewards program SME's can increase consumer acquisition and retention. Native loyalty reward programs are difficult to manage, due to the time and resource requirements, and lack of an effective platform to measure success. Third party loyalty reward programs don't directly benefit the business and are not customizable. 
Due to these challenges only companies with the resources, subject matter expertise and ability to create and manage loyalty rewards programs can take advantage of such an opportunity. SMEs that can’t allocate the necessary time and resources to managing a loyalty rewards program are deprived of a powerful tool for business growth and success.

Blockchain technology is a game changer for how business-to-business and business-to-consumer agreements can be created, managed, and leveraged. Tokens (coins) are critical to incentivize users to act favorably within the terms of the agreement. 
We built 123OTT token to take advantage of these technological advancements and make decentralized loyalty rewards programs easier to create, manage and draw value from for SMEs. Now, with 123OTT token, businesses can be connected in partnerships to create a universal loyalty rewards system. 
With 123OTT token, there’s no need to build years of trust between businesses. Consumers can now benefit from shopping within the 123OTT token network and be rewarded for their loyalty. With 123OTT token the business partnership and the agreed upon terms are all secured and immutable on the Ethereum blockchain. Decisions to change the terms of the partnership must be made collectively and everyone can easily see how the partnership is progressing. 123OTT token is a decentralized universal loyalty rewards program for small to medium sized businesses. We use smart contracts to create business-to-business partnerships where any consumer shopping within the 123OTT token network will be rewarded with tokens.

**Our mission aligns with Ethereum's to “facilitate transactions between consenting “ businesses “who would otherwise have no means to trust one another.**
This may be due to geographical separation, interfacing difficulty, or perhaps the incompatibility, incompetence, unwillingness, cost, uncertainty, inconvenience, or corruption of existing legal systems” **[Ethereum yellow paper p.1].   ** With blockchain technology we can now have business-to-business partnerships without intermediaries. Using 123OTT token's platform you can now have a decentralized loyalty reward program with better usability, security, and scalability.

#### Intro  
##### What is the Blockchain?  
A blockchain (distributed ledger) is an innovative way of storing, tracking, and transferring data (and value). The Bitcoin protocol, [1], launched in 2009, developed for the first time the idea of transferring value on a peer-to-peer decentralized basis over the internet, without the need for an intermediary. Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator(s) of Bitcoin, solved the ‘double spend’ problem when it came to digital currencies. The ‘double spend’ problem stated that digital information can easily be copied, and, therefore, a centralized authority was previously required to reflect where funds were located. The blockchain is a digital record stored on individual nodes (a network of computers) around the world. If a network is large enough with enough individual nodes, then the double spend problem would be a near impossibility. 
With the transactions replicated on many individual nodes on the network, this replication makes it highly secure. Ownership of funds is verified through cryptography and the blockchain is open for all to see and verify, therefore the full transparency of the system means that someone trying to commit fraud is immediately recognizable and any transactions submitted by such a node are ignored.
The decentralized structure of the blockchain brings several key features in contrast to traditional centralized approaches:

● Transparency: it is possible for anyone to track the movement of funds from one account to another.  
● Immutability: once confirmed, a transaction cannot be reversed. No one can interfere with a completed transfer.  
● Trustless environment: Since all transactions and changes are visible, open, and transparent 
  there is no need to worry about fraud or back door cheating.  
● Low cost: transaction fees are minimal.  
● Cross-border: funds can be sent as easily to someone on the other side of the world as they can to someone in the next room.  
● Speed: due to the flat and transparent nature of the blockchain, transfers show up almost instantly and are typically 
  confirmed in minutes, rather than hours or days.  

What Ethereum intends to provide is a blockchain with a built-in fully fledged Turing-complete programming language that can be used to create "contracts", encode arbitrary state transition functions, allowing users to create any of the systems described above, as well as many others that we have not yet imagined, simply by writing up the logic in a few lines of code.

123OTT token helps small to medium sized businesses create a loyalty rewards program to improve customer loyalty and retention.

#### What is the 123OTT token business network?  
The 123OTT token business network is a group of SMEs in agreement with each other to have a loyalty rewards system. 
As a SME joins the 123OTT token network they agree to join the loyalty rewards program and offer customers tokens as a reward for shopping with them as well as redeem tokens for products within their store. 
These agreements are strictly business-to-business and are stored in smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. 
The smart contract is structured in a way that ensures businesses fulfill their respective obligations and reach an agreed upon outcome that is mutually beneficial. 
The 123OTT token business network can help SMEs reach new customers, whilst mitigating risks.l

##### Why Small to Medium Sized Enterprises?  
Small to Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs) are being squeezed out of the market by large multinational corporations (MNCs). 
It's practically impossible for SMEs to compete on price or variety of products. 
This is partly due to globalization which helps large MNCs to outsource their workforce and pay much lower labor costs, which can in turn have them sell their products at a low price and still make a profit. SMEs often use product specialization and personalized approaches to attract target customers while multinational corporations commonly have strengths in distribution, efficiency, and mass marketing. (http://smallbusiness.chron.com/small-businesses-vs-multinational-corporations-61267.html)

SMEs are the driving force for the economy and generating the bulk of jobs in Korea and around the world “The Korea. Small Business Administration lends credence to these claims, citing internal reports that show, for example, that small companies accounted for 64% of new jobs created in the Korea. between 1993 and 2011. Small businesses, representing roughly 95% of all Korea. companies, are certainly important to the nation’s economic growth, providing employment for roughly half of Korea. employees. (These numbers are similar in Canada and internationally)”  
(https://www.fundera.com/blog/small-businesses-job-creation)

SMEs are the economic engine for jobs and innovation. Large MNCs slow down innovation in exchange for efficiency and use their political and legal power to create unnatural competitive advantages and hurt competition. Small businesses give back more to communities and have community pressure as a check and balance on their behavior. It is in the best interest of SMEs to act with integrity, fairness, and honesty as they are working directly with their community. 
For Large MNCs it’s in their best interest to succeed by any legal means necessary, for this reason big businesses often have less responsibility to the community which can result in lower wages and causing harm to the local community in other ways.

123OTT token helps small to medium sized businesses create a loyalty rewards program to improve customer loyalty and retention.

#### Technological advancements are improving our lives and how the world does business.     

Yet at the same time for large MNCs technology is being used to create greater returns for fewer people, privatize profits, shift risks and costs and eliminate jobs through technological efficiencies. Big businesses are great for investors, but when it comes to building healthy economies or creating jobs, they are a failed experiment. Research has recently proven that large corporations have the opposite effect through tax evasion, government capture, and lobbying for regulations that create barriers to entry that hurt economic growth. It is the small and local businesses, particularly those starting up, that data shows are the true engine of healthy economies and job growth. (http://www.cobrt.com/archived-blog/2014/06/big-business-hurts-economies-destroy-jobs)
SMEs don’t have the time, money, or expertise to engage in strategic partnerships, while large companies often have departments that are focused on partnerships. We’ve done our market research and have heard the reason why SMEs don’t engage in business-to-business partnerships.

Therefore, we have developed a service for the addressable market that is under served, making it simple to use as well as secure and low cost to meet their needs. When it comes to loyalty programs large enterprises are incentivized not to disrupt their current loyalty program, as they won't be able to control the supply, demand and infrastructure.

#### The Problem  
Creating strategic business partnerships can help a SMEs grow their customer base, increase revenue, and mitigate risks. Large MNCs often have dedicated resources with the sole responsibility of developing partnerships with complementary businesses. However, for most SMEs finding, managing, and leveraging strategic partnerships is a very difficult task.

A fundamental problem with traditional loyalty programs is delayed fulfillment. Customers must continue shopping to earn enough points to get a free gift sometime in the future. This post-transactional rewards system exists because in the past instant payout or immediate reductions were impossible due to the banking and retail infrastructure. Now, with the recent improvements in technology, customers expect instant returns without any complex redemption process. In addition, customers expect more freedom in redemption options for their loyalty points. Currently a customer can only redeem points at a few stores or for a select number of items. 123OTT token is a universal loyalty points system where coins can be redeemed for products and services across any business within the network.

**"Of the total membership in loyalty programs 58% are inactive" - Colloquy Loyalty Census June 2017**
"US households belong to an average of 29 loyalty programs but are active in only 12 and this figure is declining" - Colloquy Loyalty Census June 2017
LOYALTY PROGRAMS ARE FAILING

#### The reduction in customer loyalty program   
participation has left huge numbers of dormant accounts credited with only a few points, with no hope of ever accumulating enough points to get something worthwhile. Often consumers need to earn many credits, often taking months or even years, to receive the most basic rewards in the program.

Not only a significant liability for the business, the loyalty program has also become a disincentive for these low-point customers.

Without tangible rewards in real time, the existing inflexible post-transactional loyalty schemes are out of step with demand. Once they have earned enough credits, consumers are no longer prepared to make the effort needed to redeem rewards – they want it now. 
123OTT token aims to remedy this issue by issuing coins instead of reward points. These coins can be redeemed immediately against products, cash or sent to a friend as a gift.

#### Trust  
When a SME is considering entering a strategic partnership they often wonder how one business can trust another, and what parameters are in place to ensure that each will fulfill their end of the bargain? It’s critical to have restrictions in place so fraud, misrepresentation and theft do not occur. In this environment of distrust and skepticism there must be clear and actionable rules in the partnership that reward a business when they perform according to the terms of the agreements and discipline those who try to abuse or game the system.
#### Manage  
To manage a strategic partnership takes time and resources, which is something SMEs have in short supply. Often, there are legal costs involved and time spent negotiating terms. Consequently, since SMEs don’t have subject matter expertise in creating and managing strategic partnerships they often decide it’s not worth the time and effort. For SMEs to participate in strategic partnerships it must be incredibly easy and simple to manage, with very little time or experience needed to manage the relationship.
#### ROI  
Oftentimes, even if a SME has developed a great strategic partnership it's difficult to calculate and track the return on investment. A SME wants to quickly and easily know exactly how the strategic partnership is improving their business. Without a trackable and dynamic value mechanism, it’s difficult to have exact details on the success or failure of a partnership. The metrics need to be displayed in a manner that is easy to comprehend, quick to generate, and usable for decision making. In fact, the technology should be smart enough to suggest actionable info the SME can implement immediately to improve the partnership or if the partnership is failing and should be divested.

###  What is 123OTT Coin?  
123OTT token is a software company that builds simple and easy to use tools to help SMEs create, manage, and leverage universal loyalty reward programs. 123OTT token uses blockchain technology to secure business-to-business agreements and execute the terms of the partnership on the Ethereum blockchain without an intermediary. CollabCoin is building a universal loyalty rewards system that will generate value for consumers and participating businesses. 

123OTT Coin understands the limited time SMEs have and, therefore, we are focused on building tools as simple as possible with an intuitive user interface. The 123OTT Coin business network will help SMEs compete against the Large MNCs by forming partnerships. 123OTT token will award consumers for shopping at small to medium sized businesses within the network with 123OTT token which can be used for discounts, sold for cash, or gifted to someone. CollabCoin will align incentives for all parties and create a network that naturally promotes behaviors that benefit all participants. This will allow more SMEs to enter the 123OTT token business network as there is a significant decrease in risk, time, and resources.
123OTT Coin creates secure transparent trustless business partnerships on the blockchain and ties a token to track economic progress of the partnership. With blockchain technology each businesses commitments, terms, and progress are open and cannot be manipulated or fabricated. As businesses start to see the customer and revenue growth from joining the 123OTT token Network other SMEs will follow suit to benefit from the increase in customer acquisition and revenue growth.

As the 123OTT token business networks grows there will be opportunities for 123OTT token to build software to help SMEs with other facets of their business such as; supply chain management, wholesale agreements, referral programs, cross marketing, and community engagement.

Enrollment in loyalty programs across various industries in the US grew by 20 percent to 3.32 billion in 2015 from 2.65 billion just three years earlier, according to the industry benchmark COLLOQUY Loyalty Census, and more than tripled since the turn of the century”
- Deloitte: Making blockchain real for customer loyalty rewards programs  

**Top 3 Sectors for loyalty Rewards :  
1.Retail  
2.Travel and Hospitality  
3.Financial Services  
LOYALTY REWARDS IS A MASSIVE MARKET**  

#### Why Focus on Customer Loyalty Programs?  
The vast majority of adults in North America are enrolled in some form of loyalty program. 

There are many variations of programs in the market from travel rewards, punch card rewards, subscription payment reward systems and many more. However, loyalty and rewards programs are not realizing their full potential, due to “account inactivity; low redemption rates; time delays; high transaction and system management and customer acquisition costs; and low client retention.” - The 2015 COLLOQUY Loyalty Census: Big Numbers, Big Hurdles,

“Unclaimed rewards are accounted for as liabilities on company balance sheets. Those who do not redeem points are 2.7 times more likely to join another loyalty program” - The 2016 Bond Loyalty Report,
Loyalty rewards and blockchain technology are a perfect match. It’s truly a new way for businesses to grow their customer base and improve retention. The 123OTT token user experience is so overwhelmingly better than the legacy experience that it quickly invalidates the legacy model.

#### Current Loyalty Programs vs the 123OTT token Loyalty Program   

|  Current Loyalty Programs | 123OTT Loyalty Program   |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| Points must be accumulated before customer is able to redeem for a product  | Tokens can be used instantly to receive a discount, sold for cash, donated to charity, or given to a friend  |
|Points can be redeemed at either the same store or a small selection of stores and products   | Points can be redeemed at any business with the 123OTT token network, sold for cash, donated to charity, or given to a friend.  |
| Consumer data is required and stored locally on company servers or on a cloud-based system  |No detailed customer information needed in signup and data is not stored locally or in the cloud   |
|Loyalty reward platforms aren't tailored to the consumer   |  Using innovative recommendation algorithms 123OTT token will suggest products and services that are specifically curated elevating the customer experience |
|When multiple businesses are in a joint loyalty rewards program a point is valued the same everywhere   |  Businesses that are active in the 123OTT token network will have higher rewards than inactive businesses. For consumers their reward points increase the more they shop at a business encouraging further spend |
|Normally a customer is rewarded for purchasing a product or service   |Customers can be rewarded for many actions including; referring a friend, promoting a business/product on social media, staying loyal to a business for a certain amount of time, etc.   |
|No network effects to existing participants as the number of participants increases   |As the demand for coins increases the coins themselves become more valuable.   |

#### Unique Value Proposition for Businesses  
CollabCoin allows businesses to work together instead of working alone. By joining the 123OTT token network businesses can now reward their loyal customers with coins that can be redeemed at any store in the network. 
As we grow 123OTT token we will offer other ways for a business to reward their customers including; rewarding them for promoting their business on social media or referring a friend. When a business joins 123OTT token they become a part of a network of SMEs that support each other. 
123OTT token has strong network effects, which will support growth of the network once a critical mass is reached. 

As 123OTT tokenn grows the network effects will grow to a point where it is more valuable to join the network than not to. 
A 2016 study found that customers who are members of loyalty programs, such as frequent flier clubs, generate between 12 and 18 percent more revenue than non-members.
(https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/members-of-customer-loyalty-programs-generate-significantly-more-revenue-for-retailers-than-do-non-members-accenture-research-finds.htm

With SMEs are the driving force for the economy and generating the bulk of jobs in Korea and around the world “The Korea. Small Business Administration lends credence to these claims, citing internal reports that show, for example, that small companies accounted for 64% of new jobs created in the Korea. between 1993 and 2011. Small businesses, representing roughly 95% of all Korea. companies, are certainly important to the nation’s economic growth, providing employment for roughly half of Korea. employees. (These numbers are similar in Canada and internationally)”, businesses can now enter into a network of complementary businesses aligned by shared values and outcomes. This will bring a whole host of new opportunities and possibilities; an interlinked network provides unprecedented scale. As SMEs often don’t have the time or resources to manage a partnership or loyalty program they can outsource infrastructure costs and liabilities to the blockchain. Whether it's loyalty programs, cross marketing, community charity initiatives, or wholesale partnerships, 123OTT token opens a new way of doing businesses, and a new way for businesses to compete with large corporations.
By offering consumers the choice of how to redeem their loyalty coins, the value of a points currency will greatly increase. This in turn drives member engagement, and ultimately points and company sales. The result is proven and powerful.

#### Unique Value Proposition for Consumers  
Consumers want to support SMEs and local unique boutique shops in their community, however, the prices for goods compared to large multinational corporations is hard to compete with. 
123OTT token allows businesses to compete with large corporations on value by rewarding consumers for shopping with them and pass on some of the value of joining the 123OTT token network on to their customers. 
Each SMEs within the network will add to the networks value by offering rewards, deals, incentives for consumers to shop within the network. A network of interconnected SMEs is collectively greater than the sum of their parts.
The interoperability of 123OTT Coin means that the consumer is empowered with choice. Coins never expire, don't need to be accumulated, and can be used right away for goods, services, or cash. 123OTT token can even be used for charity or as a gift to a friend.

123OTT Coin is a mobile application with an incredible simple signup process as we don’t need the details of the consumer’s identity. The app will suggest products and services that are specifically curated elevating the customer experience.
####  How it works for businesses  
Retailers get what they need and want (information & loyalty). Consumers get what they need and want (preferential treatment and privacy). Neither party is burdened with the un-necessary exchange, storage, and protection of data that is not really needed to sustain the relationship.

#### Business Model & Go to Market Strategy  
123OTT Coin aims to simplify business-to-business partnerships, improving SMEs a competitive advantage when fighting against large Multi-National Corporations. 123OTT Coin is a frictionless environment where there is no need to build years of trust between business. 123OTT Coin is a decentralized business-to-business network built on the Ethereum blockchain to find strategic partners, create legally binding contracts and add value for consumers by way of loyalty rewards. This loyalty will yield increased growth and track key performance indicators around customer reach, retention, and conversion.

**Sources of revenue:**  
1) Redemption – The transactional revenue will be gained when the consumer redeems their 123OTT token for a product or service. This transaction fee, in the form of the 123OTT tokens, is deducted from the coins used at the point of redemption.
2) Advertising – Provide a platform for merchants to advertise to the 123OTT token consumers.
3) Transfers – Charge a nominal fee per coin during the transfer of 123OTT token reward coins to another consumer (e.g. 0.10%)
4) Exclusive Partnerships – Joining 123OTT token is completely free for customers and merchants. However, we charge merchants a nominal fee to enter into unique and specialized strategic partnerships with a complementary 123OTT token partner.
A common problem for platforms such as 123OTT token will be attracting suppliers to a platform without a user base. As a result, a list of strategic high-volume merchants will be on-boarded with the help of a 123OTT token representative, enrolling merchants on their behalf removing the setup overhead and burden from the merchants and transferring it to the 123OTT token team. For select merchants, key products or services will also be hosted on the platform, free of charge in order to build a strong supply base for launch.

In order to gain our first 1000 users, highly trafficked areas with a concentration of early adopters is a great launching pad for many platforms. 123OTT token will canvas university campuses incentivizing students to download the 123OTT token app which will come preloaded with reward coins of sufficient value to be immediately redeemable on select few items at nearby merchants.

Once targets within a specific area is reached based on downloads of the app and transaction at merchants, campus promotions at that campus will end and another key campus with a high population of students will be targeted.
After reaching critical mass from having “boots on the ground” 123OTT token will then turn to digital marketing to organically grow -- attracting additional merchants and consumers. 123OTT token will look to leverage Google Search Ads, Facebook Ads and YouTube Video Ads as a targeted way to reach new businesses and consumers.

#### Technical Architecture  
123OTT Coin is built on the Ethereum blockchain. Our business-to-business strategic partnerships are built using smart contracts. 
The terms and conditions of the partnership will be developed and then pushed to the Ethereum blockchain. 
As the partnership continues there will be events that will update/add data to the agreements via the Ethereum virtual machine. 
The contract can continue to exist or terminate once all required events are completed. Each interaction with the Ethereum blockchain is associated with a small transaction fee, therefore, we will only push data to the contract when a previously defined event occurs such as a desired outcome (revenue, new customers, increased engagement etc...), failed outcome, cancellation, or renewal. 
The Ethereum blockchain allows binding contracts that don’t need a 3rd party enforcer, if all conditions are not met then it will be clearly visible; this lowers risks and barriers to adoption. The Ethereum protocol is perfectly suited for creating, managing, and analyzing strategic partnerships. It is the leading protocol for smart contracts and the Ethereum network is focused on building a truly decentralized Internet -- trustless, open, and secure.
Benefits of Having Loyalty Rewards on the Blockchain
123OTT token is focused on creating a platform for business-to-business collaboration. However, traditionally introducing intermediaries heightens the chance of a security breach, while collaborating without an intermediary is hard to scale. With blockchain technology, there is no third-party intermediary.

The most successful application of blockchain until now is Bitcoin, the digital cryptocurrency. In short, loyalty rewards are also a type of digital currency, so it is only natural that the engine that enables Bitcoin to be transacted among multiple parties in exchange for services, goods, and even other monetary tender could do the same for loyalty reward points. Through a rigorous online protocol, well-programmed building blocks, and connecting a disconnected world, smart contracts and blockchain
“We maintain that blockchain will allow instantaneous and secure creation, redemption, and exchange of loyalty reward points across programs, vendors, and industries through a trustless environment using cryptographic proofs in lieu of trusted third parties and administrators.”

“A blockchain-based loyalty rewards program should reduce system management costs with smart contracts that report secure, tracked, transparent transactions to legacy systems, reducing costs associated with errors and fraud. 
A favorable byproduct of reducing these costs permits loyalty rewards program providers to drop minimum points requirements at which customers are allowed to redeem points. 
For customers, the ability to use points more readily and quickly will increase redemption transactions, reducing costs per transaction. “https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/financial-services/articles/making-blockchain-real-customer-loyalty-rewards-programs.html

#### WHY BLOCKCHAIN?  
#### technology   
have the capability to operate without intermediaries. This environment is perfectly suited for a loyalty network platform.

#### 123OTT Tokens  
It's essential for business-to-business partnerships to have a way to track progress and pass the value of their partnership onto their consumers. Currently this is often done through coupon codes, referral links, and loyalty points. 

However, the current tools available can't answer fundamental questions such as: How many coupons/referral codes/points were distributed? Exactly how many are being used by consumers? How many are held by consumers? How do I, as a business stakeholder know that my partner is promoting the partnership? And most importantly what incentives are in place to ensure both businesses adhere to the terms of the partnership? 

The 123OTT Coin token solves these problems and many others. By tying a digital coin to the terms of the agreement 123OTT Coin can now track exactly how the partnership is progressing. Also, in the unlikely event that one business is generating more transactions (referrals or coupons for example) than the other; the value of the coins given to the consumers for each transaction will increase for the business generating more transactions and decrease for the business generating less transactions. 

The consumer will naturally go to the business that gives them more coins per transaction, therefore, incentivizing both businesses to generate as many transactions as possible and allowing the behavior of the network and its software to become aligned with the interests of its users. This is critical to having successful partnerships.

Currently, many blockchain companies are issuing tokens that have no actual utility.   
The CollabCoin token can be used for many possibilities including:  

● Incentives to follow and promote the terms of the strategic partnership  
● Governance of the platform  
● Track progress of partnership  
● Increase value proposition by having consumers accumulate coins  
● A way for consumers to buy products  
● A store of value for investors  

The 123OTT token is a unit of value that is used to self-govern our business model and incentivize business and consumers to interact with each other properly. As 123OTT token grows in usage and market share, our token will help to distribute and share the rewards and benefits to all our stakeholders.

The 123OTT token  are “mined” by consumers buying products from businesses in the 123OTT token network. Each time they buy a product, a certain amount a 123OTT token are released from a smart contract on the blockchain to the consumer. When the consumer buys a product with 123OTT token the coins are sent back to the smart contract to be recycled. Therefore, 123OTT token does not hold any coins. The process is fully automated and controlled by smart contracts.

Since the 123OTT token will be traded on exchanges the value of the coin itself can change minute to minute. The value of the coins will be correlated to the cost of the product being purchased or redeemed. For example, if a 123OTT token is worth $1 each and a pair of shoes costs $100 and a

#### customer   
has 100 points than the customer will use 100 coins to get the shoes. If the next day the points are worth $100 each the customer will use one coin to buy the shoes.
