Q: I’m interested in running a node in the dark pool network, how much needs to be staked and how does it work?

A: To run a node a ‘bond’ must be staked to prevent against bad actors. This amount will be 100,000 CUBE ON. 
This amount is indicative of the mainnet requirement but amount will only be 100% confirmed once testing/feedback from the 
testnet period is complete.

Rewards are paid to the nodes in the form of fees paid by the traders for the work done matching orders.
