Ethereum
Community
Fund

Blockchains, crypto-assets, and decentralized applications are the most transformative innovations of our generation. 
While poised for substantial growth over the coming years, mainstream adoption remains at an early stage, 
and the appropriate public infrastructure to support billions of users is still a matter of deep R&D.!

The aim of the Ethereum Community Fund (ECF) is to provide both funding and connectivity, while shaping the strategic 
direction of the space towards mainstream adoption through the development of infrastructure and compelling 
end-user applications.

The first step towards supporting the growth of the Ethereum ecosystem will be the Infrastructure Grant program. 
This program will be established as a permanent financial endowment to support and aid projects in building crucial 
open-source infrastructure, tooling, and applications.
