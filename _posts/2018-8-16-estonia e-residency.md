Estonia is a small Baltic nation of 1.3 million people, but they’re leading a digital revolution in governance with the Estonia e-Residency program. It’s a country where the state drives technological innovation, not just the private sector. Since 2007, they’ve been working on proposals to digitize identity and citizenship. Today, every citizen of Estonia has their own ID card and PIN that links with their digital identity.

Recently, in 2015, Estonia opened this digital identity system up to non-citizens. Anyone in the world can now apply to become an e-resident of Estonia. Being an e-resident doesn’t confer citizenship, but it does allow you to open a bank account and start a business in Estonia. In the future, Estonia hopes to expand the capabilities of e-residency. In this article, we’ll look at what e-residency entails, how to become an e-resident, and Estonia’s future plans for digital identity and blockchain-based governance.



A Digital Nation
Estonia is well-known in the region as a tech and startup hub. They’ve been at the forefront of digitizing state services over the past few years. U.S. President Barack Obama, when visiting Estonia, remarked,

“With their digital IDs, Estonians can use their smartphones to get just about anything done online, from their children’s grades to their health records … I should have called the Estonians when we were setting up our health care website.”

Citizens can use their ID cards to vote online and all government records are accessible online. Moreover, Estonian citizens control their data. They can choose to restrict access to various information in their personal profiles.

### How to Get Estonia E-Residency
So, you’re interested in becoming an e-resident?

Let’s be clear, it likely won’t solve all your problems. The abilities of e-residents are very limited. If you’re from a developing country or do a lot of business in the European Union, however, it could be a very profitable decision. If you want to live in Estonia, however, you’ll need to go through different residency requirements.

To become an Estonian e-resident, you’ll need:  

1. copy of your current, government-issued ID  
2. passport-style photo  
3. motivation statement of why you want to become an e-resident  
4. Visa/Mastercard to pay the 100 euro fee  

That’s it. The application itself is online and fairly simple. It may take a little while to process. Once it does, you’ll have to visit the nearest Estonian consulate in-person. This could be far away from you, making this another hurdle to getting your identity card. For instance, the only office in the United States is in New York City.
