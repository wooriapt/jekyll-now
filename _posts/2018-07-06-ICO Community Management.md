ICO Community Management.

ICOs are becoming the new standard for start-ups and business ventures around the world to gain investment by communities. 
Since January 2017, start-ups have raised more than USD1.8 billion through Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs).

Blockchain technology entrepreneurs worldwide raised more money through ICO than traditional venture capital investment. 
For most of the tokens, the ICO countdown has already begun.

However, due to a lack of proper resources, manpower, and legal issues, the preparation of an ICO is a complex project. 
It is important to have the right people on board to plan and launch the ICO campaign to target potential contributors around 
the world – in particular to get numerous big investors rather than a few whales.
