### The Future of Consumer Loyalty Rewards Programs using Cryptocurrency

![logo](https://github.com/wooriapt/wooriapt.github.io/raw/master/images/points_20180730_015804025.jpg)     
**Summary:**   
Consumer acquisition and retention are a critical component of business growth and success, especially for Small to Medium Enterprises (SMEs). SMEs are the largest job creators in the world and offer great value to local communities however they are struggling to compete with large Multinational Corporations (MNCs).SMEs cannot compete on price due to the ability of MNC’s to take advantage of their economies of scale. However, with businesses working together they can reach a scale to compete on value.

> 123 OTT helps small to medium sized businesses create a loyalty rewards program to improve customer loyalty and retention.

123 OTT believes that through a business-to-business universal loyalty rewards program SME's can increase consumer acquisition and retention. Native loyalty reward programs are difficult to manage, due to the time and resource requirements, and lack of an effective platform to measure success. Third party loyalty reward programs don’t directly benefit the business and are not customizable. Due to these challenges only companies with the resources, subject matter expertise and ability to create and manage loyalty rewards programs can take advantage of such an opportunity. SMEs that can’t allocate the necessary time and resources to managing a loyalty rewards program are deprived of a powerful tool for business growth and success.  

Blockchain technology is a business game changer for how business-to-business and business-to-consumer agreements can be created, managed, and leveraged. Tokens (coins) are critical to incentivize users to act favorably within the terms of the agreement. We built 123 OTT to take advantage of these technological advancements and make decentralized loyalty rewards programs easier to create, manage and draw value from for SMEs. Now, with 123 OTT, businesses can be connected in partnerships to create a universal loyalty rewards system. With 123 OTT, there’s no need to build years of trust between businesses.   

Consumers can now benefit from shopping within the 123 OTT network and be rewarded for their loyalty. With 123 OTT the business partnership and the agreed upon terms are all secured and immutable on the Ethereum blockchain. Decisions to change the terms of the partnership must be made collectively and everyone can easily see how the partnership is progressing. 123 OTT is a decentralized universal loyalty rewards program for small to medium sized businesses. We use smart contracts to create business-to-business partnerships where any consumer shopping within the 123 OTT network will be rewarded with tokens.  

Our mission aligns with Ethereum’s to “facilitate transactions between consenting “ businesses “who would otherwise have no means to trust one another. This may be due to geographical separation, interfacing difficulty, or perhaps the incompatibility, incompetence, unwillingness, cost, uncertainty, inconvenience, or corruption of existing legal systems” [Ethereum yellow paper p.1]. With blockchain technology we can now have business-to-business partnerships without intermediaries.   Using 123OTT's platform you can now have a decentralized loyalty reward program with better usability, security, and scalability.

#### 1. What Is a Loyalty Program?

A loyalty program is an organized marketing strategy.

Merchants set them up to encourage customers to come back and buy their goods or use their services. A typical loyalty program would require a customer to register with the merchant offering the program so they can accumulate loyalty points. Depending on the type of business and the terms of the loyalty program, the loyalty points could allow customers special access to new products and services, used to get discounts on future purchases or even receive free merchandise.Some example of loyalty programs include frequent flier miles offered by airlines, restaurant points and hotel points that could be applied towards a future stay.

#### 2. Why does it matter?
Loyalty program helps a business keep a decent customer retention rate.

The less obvious answer is that it helps businesses save cost. Depending on the industry, it costs businesses between five and 25 times more to acquire a new customer than it costs to sell to an existing customer. In addition, repeat customers spend up to 33 percent more than new ones. Given these figures, it only makes sense for businesses to offer incentives, in the form of loyalty programs, to keep its existing customers happy. It also helps businesses gain valuable data about their customers’ behavior.

#### 3. But are these points valuable at all?
They kind of are.

The 2017 Colloquy Loyalty Census Report found that membership in loyalty programs grew by about 15 percent between 2015 and 2017. It’s worthy to note that the growth rate recorded in 2015 was 26 percent, showing that the growth in membership signups is slowing down. Experts believe that plenitude is at the core of the declining interest of customers. There are simply so many loyalty programs out there that it has become difficult for an average consumer to monitor every loyalty program they are a part of. Moreover, because of the numerous programs, it usually takes longer for consumers to accumulate enough points to benefit from loyalty programs. In a different report from Maritz Loyalty Marketing, 70 percent of surveyed consumers abandon loyalty rewards because it took between six and nine months to accumulate enough points to redeem rewards.

With consumers finding loyalty points less valuable and hence making them not always come back as it was intended, chances are it inherently costs businesses more to sell their goods and services. To make loyalty program deliver on the promise of improved customer retention rate, we simply need to make reward points more valuable to the consumers such that it becomes a no-brainer for them to participate actively.

#### 4. So Blockchain can add them value?

Sure!

Yes, the Blockchain, being a decentralized network, can decentralize and unify the fragmented loyalty rewards space, making reward points more valuable in the end.

A new cryptocurrency called Elements is hoping to do just that. The main goal is of the Element cryptocurrency, which uses X11, a chained hashing algorithm that is used for “Proof of Work” calculations, is to become a universally accepted loyalty cryptocurrency given and accepted by multiple merchants.

Being a “proof-of-work” cryptocurrency, Elements can be mined by anyone who has a computer with the processing power required to mine cryptocurrencies and then rewarded with some Elements for the work done. Miners can use the loyalty coins for everyday shopping and even buy, say, airline and movie tickets.

#### 5. And how does it benefit merchants?

At the basic level, a loyalty coin makes it easier for businesses to engage their customers.

At the very least, giving customers loyalty points that they can spend wherever they like, or even exchange for fiat currency, makes a merchant more valuable to customers. This should help in retaining customers. The only thing that might differentiate between competitors is how they target customers and how much loyalty coins they offer.

Another benefit of a universal loyalty cryptocurrency to merchants is that it could help them reduce their loyalty liability. Liability is an entry in the balance sheet of a company that indicates what they’re owing to other people or businesses. And since loyalty points constitute a promise to give customers discounts or even free items, which would amount to money most of the time, it has to be recorded as a liability. If every customer decides to redeem their points all at a time, or in the same period, the financial books of the company are likely to suffer. However, since anyone can participate in the mining of, for instance, Elements coins, merchants could mine for themselves and offer the loyalty coins to customers. They also get to accept loyalty coins that other merchants mine.

The traditional loyalty points have no monetary value to the merchant after it’s been spent. And that’s why it’s a win for merchants because, a Blockchain-based currency could be traded for fiat currency, helping them recoup, at least, some of the sales made with loyalty points.

#### 6. How is this valuable to Marketing Channel's ?

Marketing Channel's are also rewarded.

123 Player in the Element's  network are rewarded 50 Element coins per Local Area and the network allows them to Provision up to 144,000 coins per day. 
Like most other cryptocurrencies, these coins can be exchanged for other cryptocurrencies or fiat currencies. However, the biggest value is in the market size of the loyalty management market, which researchers at Research and Markets predict would be worth $6.2 bln by 2020. The monetary value and universal usage advantage that a cryptocurrency brings could make customers embrace it en masse, which would drive the value of the cryptocurrency itself.

It's essential for business-to-business partnerships to have a way to track progress and pass the value of their partnership onto their consumers. Currently this is often done through coupon codes, referral links, and loyalty points. However, the current tools available can’t answer fundamental questions such as: How many coupons/referral codes/points were distributed? Exactly how many are being used by consumers?   
How many are held by consumers? How do I, as a business stakeholder know that my partner is promoting the partnership?   
And most importantly what incentives are in place to ensure both businesses adhere to the terms of the partnership?   
The Ott token solves these problems and many others. By tying a digital coin to the terms of the agreement Ott tokens can now track exactly how the partnership is progressing. Also, in the unlikely event that one business is generating more transactions (referrals or coupons for example) than the other; the value of the coins given to the consumers for each transaction will increase for the business generating more transactions and decrease for the business generating less transactions.   

The consumer will naturally go to the business that gives them more coins per transaction, 
therefore, incentivizing both businesses to generate as many transactions as possible and allowing the behavior of the network and its software to become aligned with the interests of its users. This is critical to having successful partnerships.  

Currently, many blockchain companies are issuing tokens that have no actual utility.  
 
The Ott token can be used for many possibilities including:  
● Incentives to follow and promote the terms of the strategic partnership  
● Governance of the platform  
● Track progress of partnership  
● Increase value proposition by having consumers accumulate coins  
● A way for consumers to buy products  
● A store of value for investors  

The Ott tokens is a unit of value that is used to self-govern our business model and incentivize business and consumers to interact with each other properly. As CollabCoin grows in usage and market share, our token will help to distribute and share the rewards and benefits to all our stakeholders.  
The Ott tokens are “mined” by consumers buying products from businesses in the Ott token network. Each time they buy a product, a certain amount a Ott tokens are released from a smart contract on the blockchain to the consumer. When the consumer buys a product with Ott token the coins are sent back to the smart contract to be recycled. Therefore, Ott token does not hold any coins. The process is fully automated and controlled by smart contracts.    

Since the Ott tokens will be traded on exchanges the value of the coin itself can change minute to minute. The value of the coins will be correlated to the cost of the product being purchased or redeemed. For example, if a Ott token is worth $1 each and a pair of shoes costs $100 and a customer has 100 points than the customer will use 100 coins to get the shoes. If the next day the points are worth $100 each the customer will use one coin to buy the shoes. 
Ott tokens will generate a total of 400MM coins, these coins will be distributed during a token sale, please refer to Site or Blog for more information on how to support small business and join the movement.

"ERC 721 ERC-721" is a free, open standard that describes how to build non-fungible or unique tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. 
While most tokens are fungible (every token is the same as every other token), 
ERC-721 tokens are all unique.  
Think of them like rare, one-of-a-kind collectables.
