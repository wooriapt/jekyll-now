### Important to me
#### The disappearing fox
On Wednesday 7/26, the MetaMask extension was mistakenly removed from the Chrome store for several hours.   
As most of our users are on Chrome, this caused trouble for our release process and our users’ security.   
We’re back up and running smoothly, and you can read our informal post-mortem here.

**July flew by, and we’re back with another update!**  
We’ve got some big announcements here, and a fresh version of the extension (4.9.0)   
just hit browsers near you.   
Read on to learn what your new MetaMask has in store.

### Developing Compatible Dapps  
If you're a web dapp developer, we've got two types of guides for you:

 - [How to port MetaMask to a new platform](https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension/blob/develop/docs/porting_to_new_environment.md "new platform")    

    const controller = new MetamaskController({  
    // User confirmation callbacks:  
    showUnconfirmedMessage: triggerUi,  
    unlockAccountMessage: triggerUi,  
    showUnapprovedTx: triggerUi,  
    // initial state  
    initState,  
    // platform specific api  
    platform,  
})  




### New Dapp Developers  
  - We recommend this [Learning Solidity tutorial](https://karl.tech/learning-solidity-part-1-deploy-a-contract/ "tutorial")
 series by Karl Floersch.
  - We wrote a (slightly outdated now) gentle introduction on [Developing Dapps with Truffle and MetaMask.](https://medium.com/metamask/developing-ethereum-dapps-with-truffle-and-metamask-aa8ad7e363ba "Developing").

### Current Dapp Developers  
  - If you have a Dapp, and you want to ensure compatibility, [here is our guide on building MetaMask-compatible Dapps](https://github.com/MetaMask/faq/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md "here")
