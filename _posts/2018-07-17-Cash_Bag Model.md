ERC-721 is a free, open standard that describes how to build non-fungible or unique tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. 
While most tokens are fungible (every token is the same as every other token), ERC-721 tokens are all unique. 

Think of them like rare, one-of-a-kind collectables.

Blockchains, crypto-assets, and decentralized applications are the most transformative innovations of our generation. 
While poised for substantial growth over the coming years, mainstream adoption remains at an early stage, and the 
appropriate public infrastructure to support billions of users is still a matter of deep R&D.
