### Best Multi-Asset Ethereum Wallets [2018]  
Have you already made your first crypto investment and are wondering what’s next? Now it’s important to store your funds securely. Let’s review the best multi-asset Ethereum wallets!
Ethereum WalletsHere’s a no-brainer: we want to protect our funds from being misused or stolen. In our daily lives most of us trust the banks with our money. We hope our credit cards details are safe and we only store PIN codes in our heads. When it comes to keeping cryptocurrencies safe, though, it can get a little trickier.

One thing to keep in mind is that crypto transactions are irreversible. If you or someone else sends Ether from your wallet, it is virtually impossible to reverse the transaction and to receive the funds back.

Second, when it comes to fraud or theft, there is no institution to complain to or to ask for your money back. Absence of a central authority is one of the major reasons to pick crypto over traditional fiat money, but the uncontrollable nature of cryptocurrencies introduces a variety of risks and responsibilities that consumers must take to protect their assets.

Here comes the need for cryptocurrency wallets – specialised software to securely store and conveniently spend crypto. Below, we overview wallets that support Ethereum specifically, but most of them also allow storing Ethereum-based tokens and other coins.

#### Types of Ethereum Wallets  
Ethereum 지갑 유형
먼저 사용할 수있는 옵션을 살펴 보겠습니다.   
네 가지 종류의 Ethereum 지갑이 있으며 그 중 다수가 다른 크립토 통화 및 ERC20 토큰을 지원할 수 있습니다.

- 웹 인터페이스: 웹 브라우저에서 액세스 할 수있는 지갑   
  (dApp 및 스마트 계약과 같은 Ethereum 기능과 상호 작용할 수도 있음)
- 모바일 / 데스크탑 지갑: 휴대 전화 또는 PC 용 응용 프로그램
- 하드웨어 지갑: 오프라인에서 cryptocurrencies를 저장하는 물리적 장치 (콜드 스토리지 장치라고도 함)
- 종이 지갑: 공용 및 개인 키 (또는 키가 생성 된 시드)가있는 노트.

Ethereum은 사용자가 기본 블록 체인과 상호 작용할 수 있다는 점에서 독특합니다. 이것이 특정 지갑이 기본 지갑 기능 외에도 기능을 제공하는 이유입니다.

All types of wallets have their advantages. While some are very secure (hardware wallets), others are more convenient (such as mobile wallets) while others are more versatile (web interfaces). Let’s dive into specific examples!

### Ethereum Web (Desktop) Interfaces 
Ethereum and tokens, web-based clients offer ease of use without compromising on security. In fact, wallets such as MyEtherWallet and Metamask are among the best, most convenient and secure ways to store and spend Ether! For everyday use, definitely choose one of these two, if possible!

#### MyEtherWallet

For a long time, MyEtherWallet was the go-to wallet for storing and spending Ethereum and ERC20 tokens. Key reasons: it is open source, it does not store private keys, and it does not collect sensitive user information. MyEtherWallet is also regarded highly because it interacts seamlessly with hardware wallets such as Trezor and Ledger Nano S.

Metamask has become one of the most convenient Ethereum wallets. Built as a browser extension for Chrome, Firefox, Opera or Brave, it has an intuitive minimalistic interface. At the same time, Metamask is extremely rich with features: it allows users to interact with dApps, acting as an Ethereum network browser, and since recently supports spending ERC20 tokens. By the way, you can use Metamask to pay CoinGate invoices while avoiding copy-pasting addresses or scanning QR codes!

#### Hardware Wallets
- Trezor

Hardware wallets are certainly the most secure option for storing cryptocurrencies. Trezor and Ledger are the most popular hardware wallet brands, whose products support a wide range of cryptocurrencies, including Ether and tokens. Some notable alternatives are KeepKey and CoolWallet S. One downside of hardware wallets is their price, starting around $100 per device.

Trezor One is the very first, and to date perhaps the most widely owned hardware wallet, supporting over hundreds of different coins and tokens, among them Ethereum. Recently, the company released the new Trezor Model T, running on a dedicated OS and featuring a colour touchscreen.

- ledger-nano-s

Ledger Nano S is a popular mainstream alternative resembling a USB stick, and is slightly cheaper than its main competitor. Ledger Nano S supports more than 700(!) different cryptocurrencies, including a vast number of Ethereum-based tokens.

Mobile/Desktop Ethereum wallets (multi-asset)

One of the most widely used wallets in this segment is Jaxx. This application works on both Android and iOS, and also supports Windows, Mac OS, and Linux. Most importantly, the private keys never leave the device. Also, Jaxx doesn’t require registration or any input of private information of its users.

Exodus is a popular alternative that is available for desktop use (Windows, Linux and Mac). If you’re looking for a mobile-only wallet, then we would definitely recommend Coinomi. The wallet is highly regarded in the crypto community as one of the most secure multi-asset wallets, supporting over 500 different coins and tokens. Coinomi is available for both iOS and Android.

We only recommend using the same wallet on several devices if it’s an absolute necessity and you are making transactions regularly. Make sure not to store a large amount of Ethers or any other cryptocurrency on such wallets, and always make backups!

#### Paper Ethereum Wallets
Paper wallets are another type of cold storage. Contrary to hardware wallets, they are inexpensive and available for everyone. Paper wallets are, essentially, a piece of paper on which private keys or wallet seed is stored. The web-based MyEtherWallet can also generate private keys for storing Ether offline. All that is needed is to download a keystore file, print the keys and QR-code in multiple copies and store in safely.

A matter of choice
The first rule of the crypto market – you and only you are responsible for keeping your assets safe.

To this date, however, many users rely on exchanges for holding funds, even when not trading actively. The rich history of exchange hacks speaks for itself: virtually all notable exchanges lost funds at some point due to breaches. In 2018 alone hackers stole over $700 million worth of crypto from exchanges.

With all sorts of dangers, cryptocurrencies are challenging their owners in terms of security, but options are available. Whichever wallet you end up using is a personal choice, but security should always be taken seriously. Only store large quantities of cryptocurrencies offline, best case – on hardware wallets that are securely backed up.
