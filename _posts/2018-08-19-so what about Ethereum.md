### Ok, so what about Ethereum?  
Ethereum takes this “beyond the paper metaphor” approach to getting databases to work together even further than bitcoin. Rather than replacing cash, Ethereum presents a new model, a fourth way. You push the data into Ethereum, it’s bound permanently in public storage (the “blockchain”). All the organizations that need to access that information — from your cousin to your government — can see it. Ethereum seeks to replace all the other places where you have to fill in forms to get computers to work together. This might seem a little odd at first — after all, you don’t want your health records in such a system — and that’s right, you don’t. If you were going to store health records online, you’d need to protect them with an additional layer of encryption to ensure they couldn’t be read — and we should be doing this anyway. It’s not common practice to apply appropriate encryption to private data, that’s why you keep hearing about these enormous hacks and leaks.

So what kinds of things would you like as public data? Let’s start with some obvious things: your domain names. You own a domain name for your business, and people need to know that your business owns that domain name — not somebody else. That unique system of names is how we navigate the internet as a whole: that’s a clear example of something we want in a permanent public database. We’d also like it if governments didn’t keep editing those public records and taking domains offline based on their local laws: if the internet is a global public good, it’s annoying to have governments constantly poking holes in it by censoring things they don’t like.

### Crowdfunding as a test bed

Another good example is crowdfunding for projects, as done by places like KickStarter, IndieGoGo and so on. In these systems, somebody puts a project online and gather funds, and there’s a public record of how much funding has flown in. If it’s over a certain number, the project goes live — and we’d like them to document what they did with the money. This is a very important step: we want them to be accountable for the funds they have taken in, and if the funds aren’t sufficient, we want them returned where they came from. We have a global public good, the ability for people to organize and fund projects together. Transparency really helps, so this is a natural place for a blockchain.

So let’s think about the crowdfunding example in more detail. In a sense, giving money to a crowdfunding project is a simple contract:

If the account balance is greater than $10000 then fund the project, and if I contributed more than $50, send me a t-shirt. Otherwise, return all the money.

expressed as let’s pretend code, that might be:
See an actual example at https://ethereum.org/crowdsale

If you represent this simple agreement as actual detailed code, you get something like this. This is a simple example of a Smart Contract, and smart contracts are one of the most powerful aspects of the Ethereum system.

Crowdfunding potentially gives us access to risk capital backed by deep technical intelligence, and invested to create real political change. If, say, Elon Musk could access the capital reserves of everybody who believes in what he is doing, painlessly selling (say) shares in a future Mars City, would that be good or bad for the future of humanity?

Building the mechanisms to enable this kind of mass collective action might be critical to our future.
